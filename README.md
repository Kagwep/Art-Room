# Art Room - A Web3 Immersive Art Gallery

**Project Aim:** To create a decentralized, immersive art gallery experience within a web3 environment. This platform, called Art Room, allows artists to showcase their work virtually in dedicated spaces (Art Rooms) accessible by users anywhere in the world. Art Room utilizes NFTs (non-fungible tokens) for secure ownership tracking and monetization opportunities.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Frontend:** Web-based application (Babylonjs, React)
- **Backend:** Smart contracts deployed on Linea (a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum)

**Core Functionalities:**


- **Art Room Creation:** Artists can design their virtual art rooms, customizing the layout and ambience to best display their work.
- **NFT Minting & Uploads:** Artists mint their artworks as NFTs, associating them with their Art Rooms for secure ownership tracking.
- **User Exploration:** Users can explore various Art Rooms, some freely accessible and others requiring a small entrance fee paid in cryptocurrency.

**NFT Ownership & Sales (potential):**

- Users can potentially purchase NFTs directly within Art Rooms, granting them ownership of the artwork.
- Artists can choose to offer limited edition prints of their NFTs or exclusive content for NFT holders.

**Conceptual Workflow:**


1. **Art Room Creation:** Artists define the layout and design of their virtual art rooms using provided tools.
2. **NFT Minting & Uploads:** Artists mint their digital artwork as NFTs, associating them with their Art Rooms.
3. **Smart Contract Interaction:** Linea smart contracts manage NFT minting, ownership tracking, and potential future sales within Art Rooms.
4. **User Exploration:** Users can access Art Room through a web browser and explore various artist-created virtual galleries. Some Art Rooms are free to enter, while others require a small entrance fee paid in cryptocurrency using the integrated wallet functionality.

**Benefits:**

- **For Artists:** Provides a decentralized platform to showcase and monetize their work in a unique and immersive way.
- **For Users:** Offers a convenient and accessible way to experience diverse art exhibits from anywhere, with the option to own and collect digital artwork.
- **Web3 Integration:** Leverages the power of blockchain technology for secure ownership verification, transparent transactions, and innovative monetization models.
